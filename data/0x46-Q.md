# Description
Of course, 'assets' does not affect rest of the function, but particpate in logging function's result. So if the staker or administrator can make misunderstanding of analyzing this log, he will take a proper action about it and something will be gone wrong.

# Recommendation
use convertToShares() exactly.
```
uint256 assets = convertToAssets(shares);
